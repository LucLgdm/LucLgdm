# 💫 About Me:
### Hi there 👋<br><br>🎓 I'm a french young graduate (2020) with a master degree in Modelling and Numerical computation.  <br>⛪ After a change plan during 3 years : I went to a religious community in order to become a priest in the catholic church.  <br>🖥 I now want to come back in the professional world as a software developer which I used to be during my internships.  <br>🤔 I'm sharing here my schools and personals projects in order to relearn the art of programming.  <br>My programming language is C++. Some of my work is in french but th most part is in english.  <br>Yet I'm currently working at 42 school in Paris, I integrated in November 2024.<br>
