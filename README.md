### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a french young graduate (2020) with a master degree in Modelling and Numerical computation.  
â›ª After a change plan during 3 years : I went to a religious community in order to become a priest in the catholic church.  
ðŸ–¥ I now want to come back in the professional world as a software developer which I used to be during my internships.  
ðŸ¤” I'm sharing here my schools and personals projects in order to relearn the art of programming.  
My programming language is C++. Some of my work is in french but th most part is in english.  
Yet I'm currently working at 42 school in Paris, I integrated in November 2024.
